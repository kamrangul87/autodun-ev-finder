# Task Summary: Drawer UI Polish + Locate Me Button

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Station Drawer Height & Alignment Improvements

**File:** `components/StationDrawer.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Changed drawer container to use `flex flex-col` layout for better height control
- ‚úÖ Fixed mobile height to `75vh` (taller bottom sheet as specified)
- ‚úÖ Desktop: maintains full height (`h-full`)
- ‚úÖ Header and swipe indicator set to `flex-shrink-0` (no compression)
- ‚úÖ Body section now has `overflow-y-auto flex-1` for proper internal scrolling
- ‚úÖ Removed `overflow-y-auto` from main container to prevent double scrollbars
- ‚úÖ Equal-width Good/Bad buttons maintained (`flex-1` grid layout)
- ‚úÖ Visible close (√ó) button in top-right with proper touch targets (44px)

**Result:**
- Drawer stays at fixed height and never pushes map off-screen
- Clean internal scrolling in body section
- Mobile bottom sheet is taller (75vh) with proper swipe gestures
- All elements properly aligned with consistent spacing

### 2. Locate Me Button in Controls

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.jsx` - Added button and handler
- `components/EnhancedMapV2.jsx` - Added external location support

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `handleLocateMe()` function that:
  - Checks for geolocation support
  - Requests high-accuracy position (8s timeout)
  - Updates state with user location
  - Shows friendly toast messages for success/errors
  
- ‚úÖ Added "üìç Locate me" button in action-buttons row:
  - Positioned between "Zoom to data" and "Refresh"
  - Blue background (#3b82f6) matching design
  - 40px min-height for touch accessibility
  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced EnhancedMapV2 to accept `userLocation` prop:
  - Added useEffect to watch for external location updates
  - Centers map on location with zoom level 14 (minimum)
  - Works alongside existing LocateMeButton component

**Result:**
- User can click "Locate me" in main controls
- Map centers smoothly to user location
- Graceful error handling with toast notifications
- No layer toggles or data limit changes (safe operation)
