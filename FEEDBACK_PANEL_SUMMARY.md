# Feedback Panel Refactor - Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Updated `components/StationDrawer.tsx`

The feedback panel has been completely refactored to match the exact specifications:

#### **Layout & Dimensions**
- ✅ **Desktop:** Right-side drawer, exactly **380px** width, full height (`h-dvh`)
- ✅ **Mobile:** Bottom sheet, **max-height 70vh**, rounded top corners
- ✅ Internal scroll for content overflow, no page scroll jumps
- ✅ Map remains fully visible behind/alongside the panel

#### **Content Structure (in order per spec)**

1. **Header Row**
   - Station name (bold, 18px, leading-tight)
   - Close (×) button (top-right, 44px hit area)

2. **Meta Section** (small, muted text)
   - Address (1 line, truncated with tooltip on hover)
   - Connectors count (e.g., "Connectors: 5")

3. **Feedback Controls**
   - Label: "How was this station?"
   - Good/Bad buttons (mutually exclusive)
     - Uses `aria-selected` (not aria-pressed)
     - Selected state: blue background/border
     - Equal width, inline-flex layout
   - Comment textarea (4 rows)
     - Placeholder: "Any details? e.g., broken connector, blocked bay, pricing issue."
     - Max 280 characters

4. **Status Messages** (inline)
   - Success: "✓ Thanks for your feedback!" (green)
   - Error: "Couldn't submit. Please try again." (red)

5. **Actions Row**
   - Submit feedback (primary blue button, disabled until vote selected)
   - Cancel (secondary border button, clears form and closes)
   - Get directions (link button below, opens in new tab)

#### **UX Behaviors**

- ✅ **Open/Close:**
  - Opens on marker click
  - Close methods: × button, Cancel button, Escape key, backdrop click (mobile)
  - Map does NOT re-center or auto-pan

- ✅ **Focus Management:**
  - Focus trapped inside panel while open
  - First focusable element auto-focused on open
  - Focus returns to trigger on close

- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Tab order sensible (header → meta → controls → actions)
  - Enter activates primary action
  - Escape closes panel

- ✅ **Accessibility:**
  - `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`
  - `aria-labelledby` points to station name
  - All buttons have `aria-label`
  - Good/Bad use `aria-selected` for state

#### **Visual Design**

- **Spacing:** 16-24px padding, 16px grid
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy, no text overflow
- **Buttons:** Consistent sizing, clear selected states
- **Mobile:** Drag grabber bar (12px × 1.5px gray rounded)
- **Backdrop:** Semi-transparent black overlay (mobile only)

#### **Technical Implementation**

- ✅ Portal-based rendering (`createPortal` to `document.body`)
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with map DOM
- ✅ State managed in component (vote, comment, submitStatus)
- ✅ Success status auto-resets after 2 seconds
- ✅ Error status persists until form interaction
- ✅ Cancel button resets all state and closes panel
- ✅ Swipe-to-close on mobile (50px threshold)

## ✅ **Acceptance Checklist**

- ✅ Internal scroll, no page scroll-jumps
- ✅ Clear Good/Bad selection, comment textarea, Submit/Cancel, Get directions
- ✅ Close works by ×, Cancel, backdrop (mobile), and Esc
- ✅ Focus trapped inside panel; returns to marker on close
